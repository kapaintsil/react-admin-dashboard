# Admin Dashboard Project

This is an Admin Dashboard project built with **React** and **Vite**. The dashboard showcases various key skills learned during its development, including chart creation, responsive design, and the integration of dynamic data. 

**Live Demo:** [Admin Dashboard](https://admin-dashboard-red-phi.vercel.app/)

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Charts**: Developed dynamic, interactive charts using **echarts** and **react-apexcharts**.
- **Responsive Design**: Built a fully responsive dashboard using **Bootstrap**, making the dashboard accessible and user-friendly across various screen sizes.
- **Data Simulation**: Demonstrated how to serve JSON data using **json-server**, simulating a backend API for dynamic data interaction in the frontend.
- **Modern UI Components**: Created reusable, customizable components to present data in a clean and organized manner.

## Skills Learned:

### 1. **Chart Development**:
   - Integrated **echarts** and **react-apexcharts** to display dynamic data visualizations in the form of graphs and charts.
   - Learned how to customize and configure chart properties for different data sets.
   - Gained an understanding of how to use charts to present data in a meaningful and user-friendly manner.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Improved skills in creating responsive layouts using **Bootstrap** CSS framework.
   - Used **flexbox** and **grid** systems to ensure the dashboard is mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.
   - Ensured that all components adjusted appropriately to screen changes, providing a seamless experience across devices.

### 3. **Working with JSON Data**:
   - Used **json-server** to simulate a backend API by creating mock data for demo purposes.
   - Set up routes to handle data retrieval and updates, mimicking real-world server-side functionality.
   - Learned how to integrate this mock server data into React components dynamically.

### 4. **Component Development**:
   - Created reusable, modular components to handle different aspects of the dashboard.
   - Each component was designed to handle specific data, such as charts, tables, and statistics, making the codebase cleaner and more manageable.
   - Demonstrated the ability to pass data to components and render it dynamically.

## Tech Stack:
- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive UI.
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster development and optimized production builds.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive layout and design.
- **Echarts** and **react-apexcharts**: Libraries used for creating interactive and customizable charts.
- **json-server**: Tool used to mock a RESTful API for demo purposes.
